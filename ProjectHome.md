or <b>R</b>apid <b>S</b>erial <b>V</b>isual <b>P</b>resentation to read text.

This means that instead of showing a page of text at a time we instead show only one word.  This is handy because we can make the word much larger, so you don't have to hunt for your glasses to read something on the small screen.

We also bookmark any files you read so that you continue where you left off (down to the sentence).

Adjusting the speed can be done my slightly tilting the device or my pressing the display or mouse.
